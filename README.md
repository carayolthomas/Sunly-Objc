# Sunly
☀️ The app that makes the weather friendly

## ☀️ About
Sunly is the app to know your best friends weather. It will also tell you where to spend your next week-end 🌴

At the very beginning, I had to build a weather app for getting hired at [Shadow](https://shadow.tech). Of course, I couldn't do just a simple weather app like many others. So, I tried to find real life situation when you need to check the weather. It took me sometimes but I came up with this idea. I talked about it to my friends, many of them where very enthusiatic and proposed me many features to implement so I decided to make it open source and we will see what happens...

Of course, I am still hoping to join the [Shadow](https://shadow.tech) 💻

## 🐍 Architecture
I decided to deal with this app like it could become a big one. So I've used the [VIPER](https://medium.com/@smalam119/viper-design-pattern-for-ios-application-development-7a9703902af6) architectural pattern.
This is a kind of Clean Architecture for iOS applications.

## 🛠 Dependencies
I didn't have enough time to create animation from scratch so I used [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/) to import existing animation.
I use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) as dependency manager.
